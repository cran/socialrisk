Description: Social risks are increasingly becoming a critical component of health
    care research. One of the most common ways to identify social needs is by using
    ICD-10-CM "Z-codes." This package identifies social risks using varying taxonomies
    of ICD-10-CM Z-codes from administrative health care data. The conceptual
    taxonomies come from:
    Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (2021) <https://www.cms.gov/files/document/zcodes-infographic.pdf>,
    Reidhead (2018) <https://www.mhanet.com/mhaimages/Policy_Briefs/PolicyBrief_SDOH.pdf>,
